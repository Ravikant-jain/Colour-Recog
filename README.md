# Color Name Prediction from Images using ANN

This repository contains code for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts the dominant color name in a given picture. 
The model is trained on 255 images downloaded from the internet and uses the TensorFlow library.

Key Features:

Color Name Prediction: Accurately identifies the most prominent color in diverse images.
TensorFlow-Based: Built using the powerful TensorFlow library for efficient model construction and training.
Trained on 255 Images: Leverages a dataset of 255 internet-sourced images for model learning.

Training

The training process involved the following steps:

Data Collection: 255 images were gathered from various online sources, ensuring a diverse representation of colors.
Data Preprocessing: Images were resized, normalized, and prepared for training.
Model Architecture: Implemented an Artificial Neural Network using TensorFlow with 6 layers.
Training: The model was trained on the collected dataset for 200 epochs, achieving a accuracy of 99.4%.
